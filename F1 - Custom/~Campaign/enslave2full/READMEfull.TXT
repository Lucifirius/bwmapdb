ENSLAVERS: DARK VENGEANCE CAMPAIGN README

This campaign requires Brood War to play.

This zip file contains all five episodes of a new campaign that 
was released in monthly installments at http://www.blizzard.com, 
as well as an epilogue.

To have these levels run properly, they must ALL be placed in the 
Campaign Folder in your Starcraft/Maps/ directory.  Also, if you open 
these maps in your campaign editor, there are certain AI scripts 
that may not be visible or accessible.  Enjoy!
