Installation

To play the campaign, place all the .scm files from 
soc.zip in your StarCraft maps directory, usually 
C:\Program Files\Starcraft\maps (your path may differ).  We 
recommend you create a new folder within the maps folder 
to put this map in (i.e. Starcraft\maps\SoC).  After the files are
put within the maps directory, the map can be accessed through the 
Single Player 'Play Custom' interfaces within StarCraft.  All files 
MUST be in the same folder, or the campaign will not work properly.
Start with "SoC1.scm"

This campaign can be played with StarCraft version 1.04 or later,
or Brood War.

Story Line

This campaign takes place just after the Zerg began their infestation
of Mar Sara.  Tassadar will be sent to investigate and destroy the
Zerg presence.

Special Thanks

Thanks to Da Reaper for the Force Field Effect in Mission 3, all the
sounds he sent me as soon as I asked, and for the extra AIs.  They
really make the Epilogue look cool.
