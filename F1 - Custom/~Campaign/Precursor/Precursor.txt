STARCRAFT PRECURSOR CAMPAIGN README
This zip file contains the campaign found in the Starcraft Demo.  
To have these levels run properly, they must be placed in the 
Campaign Folder in your Starcraft directory.  Also, if you open 
these maps in your campaign editor, there are certain AI scripts 
that will not be visible or accessible.  Enjoy!
